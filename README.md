STT 301 Tennis Final project

We trained ten years of retroactive professional tennis odds and then devised multiple gambling strategies to test for three retroactive years.

The raw data can be found in csv files under the "Data" folder. However, the cleaned and combined dataset used for the analysis and testing is titled men.filtered.data.RData.

Visit the data dictionary in order to understand the column headings of our dataset.

The code for the data training is under the title Analysis_2001_to_2016.Rmd.

We compared each of the devised gambling formulas to a series of baseline strategies. These baseline results can be viewed under Baseline_Strategies with tables.Rmd.

(Nick's Final Code.Rmd compounds all of these Rmd files into one set of code.)

Our group presentation slides are under the name STT 301 Project Presentation.pptx.
